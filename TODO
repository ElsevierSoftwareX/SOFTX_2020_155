When the front-end is loaded into the kernel, need to make sure
it is nto trying to load itself on the CPU code which is taken by another
model's front-end. Jamie had c1lsc locking up when loading c1cal on the cpu 4
when c1oaf was already running there.

Need to integrate iniChk.pl script into the Epics sequencer C code.

Jamie reported a bug in file nameing which needs to be fixed:

      Investigations seem to indicate that the situation has been like this
      for a long time.  I thought we had decided that we would always just use
      the first five characters of model names in all circumstances, but I
      guess that never got put in place (although I'm still puzzled why there
      would be references to screens that never would have existed).  The most
      important thing at this point is to just be consistent, and since most
      things seem to be assuming full model name, we should just settle on
      that.

      Alex, if you can modify feCodeGen to consistently generate all screen
      names based on the full model name that would be great.  Thanks.

      jamie.

Subject: [cds-announce] EPICS records for cdsIPCx errors

      Hi, all.  I have an RCG feature request:

      I would like to request that the cdsIPCx receivers auto-generate an
      EPICS record that records transmission errors.  This would make it much
      easier for us to add MEDM indicators that report the state of specific
      IPCx channels.

      I notice that the RCG developers guide doesn't actually explain how the
      Err output behaves (it would be nice if it did), but the IPC document
      [T1000587] does: the Err output apparently reports the number of errors
      per second.  I assume that means that at every EPICS sample the output
      is the number of errors in the last second.  I think that's ok for
      front-end models, since anything non-zero indicates current loss of
      integrity.  I think it would be nice to have something a little
      different for the EPICS record, though.  I would suggest they keep a
      running tally of the number of errors since the last "DIAGNOSTICS
      RESET".  That way it won't clear automatically if the error rate returns
      to zero.

      I think it would also be nice if the GDS_TP screens included a section
      with indicators for these EPICS records for all of the IPCx receivers in
      the model.  That seems like a logical place to have them automatically
      called out.

      jamie.
