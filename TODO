Need to integrate iniChk.pl script into the Epics sequencer C code.

Jamie reported a bug in file nameing which needs to be fixed:

      Investigations seem to indicate that the situation has been like this
      for a long time.  I thought we had decided that we would always just use
      the first five characters of model names in all circumstances, but I
      guess that never got put in place (although I'm still puzzled why there
      would be references to screens that never would have existed).  The most
      important thing at this point is to just be consistent, and since most
      things seem to be assuming full model name, we should just settle on
      that.

      Alex, if you can modify feCodeGen to consistently generate all screen
      names based on the full model name that would be great.  Thanks.

      jamie.
