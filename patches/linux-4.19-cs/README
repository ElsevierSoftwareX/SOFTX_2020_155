These are the patches and config files developed by Gerrit Kuehn, 
Keith Thorne and Rolf Bork to create a stable 'cs' (CPU Shutdown) 
linux kernel 4.19 for CDS real-time.  Both the patch and config file are needed

- For LIGO CDS, use the final -cs files (not -aei-cs)   

- Basic CDS patch - adds CPU Shutdown only
kernel-4.19-cs.patch

- Custom kernel config file for Gentoo at AEI - creates monolithic kernel with a minimum of drivers
config-4.19.37-aei-cs

- Custom kernel config file for Debian 10 - derived from AEI work but updated to newer kernel
-- Has fix for nomodeset on AST VGA chips
-- Re-enables kernel module versioning
config-4.19.67-cs
