linux-2.6.34.1-cs.patch produced at LHO in August 2010.
We ran it on the diskless nodes, which had sysfs not configured in the kernel.
This fixed a problem with notifiers (see cpu.c where the call is commented out).
Also see ././linux-2.6.34.1-cs.config, out kernel .config file.


linux-2.6.34-cs-patch produced at Hannover in July 2010


linux-2.6.23-realtime.patch registers front-end code callbacks and exposes
cpu_up() and cpu_down() calls


rtai-linux-2.6.23-x86_64.patch is the patch to expose _cpu_disable() call.
Prerequisite: hal-linux-2.6.23-x86_64-1.4-03.patch from RTAI vulcano
