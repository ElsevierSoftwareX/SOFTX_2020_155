Verify that we run OK without multithreaded RPC
Just in case; multi-threaded Linux RPC library:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mtrpc/


gdsheartbeat.c needs to have nanosleep() replaced with X00
cycle reading code in installSignal()


build daqd with testpoint.o, do not link with libtestpoint


Need to find a good way to set parameters (archive, site, ifo) in awgtpman.c



testpoint_server.c need to pick up next available RPC number 
(rpcRegisterService) instead of relying on testpoint.par setting. Same for awg.
