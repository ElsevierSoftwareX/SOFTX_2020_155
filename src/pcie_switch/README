The subdirectories contain the software necessary to run the long range PCIe network:
  - kmod:
  	Contains the cdsrfmswitch.c code. This is the source for the real-time kernel code that 
	transfers data between corner and end station Dolphin switches.
  - cdsrfmepics:
  	Contains the interface code between cdsrfmswitch kernel and EPICS:
		- cdsrfmmonitor.py: Gets data from cdsrfmswitch.ko, via /proc/cdsrfm file, and posts 
		  		    it to EPICS database records.

Building the code:
	The kmod directory contains a Makefile to build the kernel object.  Within that directory,
	simply execute 'make' command.  This should result in the production of a cdsrfmswitch.ko
	file.

Running the code:
  1) Log on to the computer that is to run the cdsrfmswitch real-time code.
  2) From the kmod directory, execute the command 'sudo insmod ./cdsrfmswitch.ko
  	- Checking dmesg should indicate that the code has been started.
	- Running 'cat /proc/cdsrfm' should produce a line of numbers (switch status info).
  3) From the cdsrfmepics directory, execute the command './cdsrfmepics.py IFO &', where 
     IFO = CDS IFO prefix eg X2,H1,L1, etc.
     --- NOTE: This code may only be run on the cdsrfmswitch computer, as it must have
               access to the /proc/cdsrfm file.
  5) Bring up the cdsrfmswitch MEDM screen and verify operation.
