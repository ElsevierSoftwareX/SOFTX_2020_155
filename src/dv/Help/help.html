<h2> <a NAME="start">Getting Started</a></h2>
<p>
Directory: this version of the DataViewer is at<br>
<DD>/opt/CDS/f/cvs/cds/project/daq/dv/G4.3/<br><br>
Before starting the DataViewer, $DVPATH has to be set to the path where 
the DataViewer is installed.<br><br>
To start the DataViewer,  type <br>
<DD>$DVPATH/dataviewer -s &nbsp&lt;Data Server IP Address&gt;<br>
<i>e.g.</i>&nbsp &nbsp  $DVPATH/dataviewer -s&nbsp 131.215.113.11 <br><br>
This will start the <A HREF="Images/control.gif">DataViewer Control</A>:
<br><br><center><A HREF="Images/control.gif"><IMG src="Images/control_s.gif"
width=417 height=195 border=0></A></center>
<br><br>
Clicking 
<IMG ALIGN=middle WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=28 SRC="Images/play.gif"> (<B>Play</B>) 
button at the upper left part of the control panel
will start the <A HREF="Images/timebase.gif">Grace display window</A>.
By default, the first channel in the Server configuration will be 
displayed in realtime mode.
<i>Note</i>: The graph may look blank if the data values of the signal
fall outside the default Y-range. In this case the
Y-Axis setting needs to be adjusted (see the topic
<a href="#adjust">Adjusting and Saving Settings</a> below).
<br><br>
Other options: (type &nbsp dataviewer -h to see all options)<br>
<DD> -s &nbsp&lt;Server IP Address&gt
<DD> -x &nbsp&lt;Grace Display IP Address&gt
<DD> -p &nbsp&lt;Server Port&gt
<DD> -r &nbsp&lt;Restore File&gt
<br><br>
DataViewer can also be started by
<DD>$DVPATH/dataviewer -F<br> or
<DD>$DVPATH/dataviewer -f &nbsp&lt;Frame File&gt<br>
if frame files are going to be used as a data source instead of a server. See 
<a href="#frame">Frame File</a> for the usage.
<br><br><hr>

<h2> <a NAME="signal">Selecting and Changing Signals</a></h2>
<p>DataViewer can load up to 16 channels. When DataViewer is connected 
to a server, the first 16 signals from the Server configuration
are automatically loaded into the 16 channels respectively. By default, 
only the first channel will be displayed. You may select the channels 
to be displayed from
the <A HREF="Images/chansel.gif">channel select panel</A> which is 
located at the right side of the control panel. Multiple
selection is enabled since version 8.0.
<p>In order to change the signal for a particular channel, first open the
<A HREF="Images/sigsel.gif">Signal Selection window</A> by selecting
the  pull-down menu <b>Main->Signal Select</b> (located on the 
<A HREF="Images/top.gif">top panel</A>). The left side shows the
current signal names in the (up to 16) channels.
<BR><BR>
Version G3.0 and above allow a signal name to be dragged (from
DataViewer or other applications) and dropped
in a particular channel. A signal could also be selected from the
Signal Selection Window as following:
The area under <b>Group Names</b> shows all of the current 
available groups. Clicking on a group name, the area under
<b>Signal Names</b> will show the list of signal names inside the group. 
When <B>Fast</B> (or <B>Slow</B>, <B>DMT.</B>, <B>OBSLT.</B>) 
is selected, only fast (or slow, DMT, Obsolete) 
channels are shown. Select the desired signal. Then
select the channel number by entering the number at the <B>New signal
selected for Ch.</B> field or using the increasing/decreasing arrow buttons. 
Click <b>Select</b> to make the change.<br><br>
All channels can also be changed at once by using <b>Main->Restore</b> 
if there is a pre-saved file.
<br><br><hr>

<h2> <a NAME="adjust">Adjusting and Saving Settings</a></h2>
<IMG WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=37 ALIGN=right SRC="Images/middle_ch.gif">
<p>The <A HREF="Images/middle.gif">middle portion</A> of the control panel 
shows the settings of the highlighted channel. To change the highlighted 
channel, use the channel pull down menu as shown in the picture.
<p>To adjust X or Y Axis settings for a channel: first make this channel
as the highlighted channel. Notes: (1) The highlighted channel will
automatically become selected on the <A HREF="Images/chansel.gif">channel 
select panel</A>. (2) It's not necessary to mark the <B>Highlight</B>
checkbox, which gives an option to turn on/off the large graph at the 
upper left corner of the display (see <a href="#off">Highlighted 
Signal On/Off</a>).
<p><b>X Axis</b>:
X-Axis is measured in seconds. The selection can be made from the 
pull-down menu
<b>X Axis</b>. The maximum is 16 seconds and the default
is set to 8. A <b>Delay</b> can be set in 1/16 second of increment.
<p><b>Y Axis</b>: To adjust Y scales, hand type the range in the 
<b>Y-Min</b> and <b>Y-Max</b> text fields.
Different types of Y Scales are also available. See <a href="#yscaletype">Y
Scale Type</a> for details.
<p><b>Auto</b>:By checking <b>Auto</b> checkbox, Grace will
automatically set the proper display Y-range for the highlighted channel.
However it is not recommended to use auto setting for the general 
display - especially not for displaying too many channels, since it may 
slow down the display. <b>Auto</b> is designed to be used  
for locating the curve and then the Y-Axis scale should be set manually. 
<p><b>Global Setting</b>: If <B>Global</B> (located at the bottom of
the middle portion) is checked, any adjustment will
affect all channels rather than the highlighted channel only.

<br><br>
Once all settings are adjusted, you may save them to a file for later
recalls. To save, use <b>Main->Save</b>; to restore, use
<b>Main->Restore</b> from the <A HREF="Images/top.gif">top
panel</A>.

<h2> <a NAME="displayaction">Display Action</a></h2>
<p><a NAME="stop"><b>Stop</b></a>: While in 
<IMG WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=27 SRC="Images/stop.gif"> (<B>Stop</B>), the Grace
display is in an interactive mode. You may use any Grace menu or buttons.
For the usage of Grace, see
<a href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/doc/UsersGuide.html">Grace User's
Guide</a>.
<p><a NAME="realtime"><b>Play</b></a>: 
If <IMG WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=28 SRC="Images/play.gif"> (<B>Play</B>)
is selected, data is displayed in a realtime mode, with possibly a
1-2 second delay from the time it is actually acquired. The display
is in general updated once per second. For certain cases it could
be updated up to 16 times per second (see later topic
<a href="#refresh">Refresh Rate</a> for more details). 
<p><a NAME="pause"><b>Pause</b></a>: 
The <IMG WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=28 SRC="Images/pause.gif"> (<B>Pause</B>)
feature is designed for trend
data display only. Pressing this button will stop the display while
the realtime trend data being recorded. To resume, select Play
again. For non-trend display it works as same as Stop.
<br><br><hr>

<h2> <a NAME="long">Playback</a></h2>

<p>Along with realtime data display, data stored by the Data Server may
also be recalled for presentation in Grace. Playback produces one or
more new Grace window(s)
and displays all information for the given display period at once.
<I>Note</I>: It will not start the display until all of the data information
has been read. Thus more data requested, longer loading time will be needed.
<p>
To use Playback, select the <b>Playback</b> from the <b>Main</b>
menu. This will bring up
the <A HREF="Images/long.gif">Playback control panel</A>. Up to 16
channels can be chosen from the upper left corner of the Playback control.

<DL>
<DD><a NAME="timeset"><b>Time Settings for Playback</b></a>:
<br><br>
<DL>
<DD><b><i>reference time</i>:</b> the first line of the time seting is
the time for starting or ending the display, depending on the choice
of the toggled menu <b>Stop Time/Start Time</b>.
To set it, enter
the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second into the fields at the
first row of Time Setting. To quickly set all fields to the current
time, simply click <b>Quick Set</b>.<br><br>
<b><i>duration</i>:</b> the second line of the time setting is the 
length of time period for playback. Enter the days, hours, minutes,
and seconds into the fields at the second row.
 <br><br>
There is also a choice of using GPS time instead of UTC time for the setting.
 <br><br>
<DD><i>example</i>:<br><br>
<DD><IMG WIDTH=498 HEIGHT=162 SRC="Images/timeset.gif">
<DD><br>reference time: 00:09:08:18:58:38<br>

<h2> <a NAME="tip">Other Tips</a></h2>
<p> <a NAME="xmgr"><b>Some useful Grace Tips</b></a>:
<p> <i>Note</i>: Make sure the Grace is in an interactive mode (Stopped) before
applying any of the followings.
<ul>
  <li><i>view data set properties</i>: Grace allows user to view data information
      for each graph. Click on the graph you want to look at. Then select
      <b>Edit->Data set</b> from the pull-down menu of the Grace window. A
      "Data set properties" window will pop up and for each graph set 
      the information
      such as X and Y maximum/minimum can be displayed. This is a 
      convenient way to find out the
      the proper display range. Then Y-axis range can be set accordingly.
  <li><i>save Grace file</i>: the current plots can be saved as a Grace
      file and reopened by Grace. Use the pull-down menu
      <b>File->Save as</b> and type in a file name. To reopen, use
      <b>File->Open</b>.
  <li><i>adjust scales</i>: X and Y scales are adjustable from Grace
      directly. Use <b>Plot->Axis Properties</b>.
</ul>
For more usage of Grace, see
<a href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/doc/UsersGuide.html">Grace User's
Guide</a>.
</p>

<br>
<p> <a NAME="debug"><b>Status Report/Debugging Information</b></a>:
Status report and debugging information are shown at the special
status report window if using $DVPATH/dataviewer, or at the terminal window
where the DataViewer Control is started if using $DVPATH/dataviewer0. 
It shows the general display
information, user's selections, warnings and error messages. While data
being displayed, it shows the time stamp of the displayed data and 
indicates any block drop as well. It is advised to check the message 
window whenever you experience something 'weird'.</p>
<br>
<p> <a NAME="trouble"><b>Troubleshooting</b></a>:
<p> <i>Note</i>: Always check the <a href="#debug">status messages</a>
first. It may help to target the problem(s) sooner.
<ul>
<li><b>problem:</b> <i>can not start the DataViewer Control</i>.<br>
    <b>possible causes:</b><br>
     1. the variable $DVPATH is not set.<br> 
     2. no data server is available.<br> 
    <b>suggestions:</b><br> 
     1. set the variable $DVPATH to the directory where DataViewer is

     2. make sure the server IP address is typed
        correctly and the server is running.<br>
    <br>
<li><b>problem:</b> <i>DataViewer hangs</i>.<br>
    <b>possible cause:</b> too many message queues are running on the
       current machine.<br> 
    <b>suggestion:</b> check the list of message queue (ipcs -b) and
       kill the ones which are not in use  
       (ipcrm -q &nbsp&lt Queue ID &gt)<br> 
    <br>
<!--<li><b>problem:</b> <i>can not start the Grace display</i>.<br>
    <b>possible cause:</b> lisener port number conflicts. Note that
    any port number can only be used by one user on the same machine.<br> 
    <b>suggestion:</b> exit the program and restart it with different
    lisener port number (use -l option). The default lisener port number
    is 7000. <br>
    <br>-->
<li><b>problem:</b> <i>realtime Grace display doesn't keep up the speed</i>.<br>
    <b>suggestions:</b> <br>
    1. set smaller X-Axis range.<br>
    2. do not use Auto setting for display.<br>
    3. display less channels, especially when higher refresh rate is
    used.<br>
    4. reduce the resolution.<br>
    5. reduce the refresh rate.<br>
    <br>
<li><b>problem:</b> <i>unexpected Grace display interuption</i>.<br>
    <b>possible causes:</b><br>
    1. the display is triggered.<br>
    2. data server interruption.<br>
    <b>suggestions:</b> <br>
    1. check if the <b>Trigger Enable</b> box is marked and check the status
    report.<br>
    2. re-connect to the server by using 
       <b>Main</b>-><b>New Connection</b>.<br>
    <br>
<li><b>problem:</b> <i>no action being taken after a selection</i>.<br>
    <b>possible cause:</b> the connection between control and display
    is not established; this
    could be caused by a network error.<br>
    <b>suggestion:</b> check the status messages on the message
    window. The line
    <P ALIGN=center>messg received *************************</P>
    should appear after each selection. If not, select <b>Main->New 
    Connection</b> to quit the current Grace display and
    start a new one.<br>
    <br>
<li><b>problem:</b> <i>graphs flash in Grace display</i>.<br>
    <b>possible cause:</b> Auto settings are being used for two or
    more channels.<br>
    <b>suggestion:</b> uncheck <b>Auto</b> and manually set Y Axis
    ranges for all channels.
    see the Usage of Auto Setting under the topic
