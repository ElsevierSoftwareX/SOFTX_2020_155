DataViewer Version G4.5

We've switched from Xmgr to Grace.

Start from version 9.0, the setting files will be
saved in XML format. Files which were saved by
older versions (V5 - 7) need to be converted to 
v8 by using 
  saveV5toV8 <oldfile> <newfile>
then convert v8 to v9 by
  saveV8toV9 <oldfile> <newfile>.

VIEW DATA FROM SERVER:

Start the DataViewer with
   $DVPATH/dataviewer0 -s <Server IP>
or
   $DVPATH/dataviewer -s <Server IP>
which shows the messages on a new X term.

Use ./dataviewer0 -h to see other options

The following files are necessary to run the dataviewer using data server:

    dataviewer (dataviewer0)
    dc3
    framer4
    frameMemRead
    leapsecs.dat - should be adjusted for new leap seconds
    checklock
    dcstart
    xmgrace




VIEW DATA FROM FRAME FILES:

1. the DataViewer could be started without specifying a server:
   $DVPATH/dataviewer0 -F
   or
   $DVPATH/dataviewer -F
2. Go to Main menu. Main -> Frame Files:
   Make TOC File: Point to the directory which contains ONLY Frame 
       files. The generated TOC file (outtoc) will be placed in the
       directory. (Note: TOC file could be generated without using
       Dataviewer. Command: 
       tocgenerate <Frame files directory> <output toc file name> )
   Open TOC File: Point to the toc file which will be displayed
   Open Frame File Directory: Point to the directory which contains 
       ONLY Frame files. (Playing time period is not selectable for
       trend data from Frame files)
3. use Main -> Playback to display data.
      

The following files are necessary to run the dataviewer:

    checklock
    dataviewer (dataviewer0)
    dc3
    dcstart
    frgenerate
    frLongFile
    leapsecs.dat - should be adjusted for new leap seconds
    maketoc
    readframe
    readtoc
    tocgenerate
    tocLongFile
    tocLongRead
    xmgrace
