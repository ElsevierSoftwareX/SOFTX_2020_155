.SH DESCRIPTION
A
.B struct caldate
value is a calendar date.
It has three components:
.BR year ,
.B month
(1...12),
and
.B day
(1...31).
.SH CONVERSIONS
Every calendar date has a
.I modified Julian day number\fR.
The day number increases by 1 every day.
Day number 0 is 17 November 1858.
Day number 51604 is 1 March 2000.

.B caldate_frommjd
puts into
.I cd
the date corresponding to the modified Julian day number
.IR day .

.B caldate_frommjd
also computes the day of the week (0 through 6)
and the day of the year (0 through 365).
It stores the day of the week in
.B *\fIweekday
if
.I weekday
is nonzero.
It stores the day of the year in
.B *\fIyearday
if
.I yearday
is nonzero.

.B caldate_mjd
returns the modified Julian day number corresponding to the date in
.IR cd .

.B caldate_mjd
accepts days outside the range 0 to 30,
referring to days before the beginning or after the end of the month.
It also accepts months outside the range 0 to 11,
referring to months before the beginning or after the end of the year.

.B caldate_mjd
does not check for overflow.
.SH FORMATTING
.B caldate_fmt
prints
.I cd
in ISO style (yyyy-mm-dd)
into the character buffer
.IR s ,
without a terminating NUL.
It returns the number of characters printed.
.I s
may be zero;
then
.B caldate_fmt
returns the number of characters that would have been printed.

.B caldate_scan
reads a calendar date in ISO style
from the beginning of the character buffer
.I s
and puts it into
.IR cd .
It returns the number of characters read.
If
.I s
does not start with an ISO-style date,
.B caldate_scan
returns 0.
.SH NOTES
The
.B caldate
routines currently support the Gregorian calendar,
which was defined in 1582 and adopted at different times
in different countries.
For earlier dates the
.B caldate
routines work with
``virtual Gregorian,''
defined mathematically by the 400-year Gregorian cycle
for years before 1582.
The Julian calendar is not supported.

The Gregorian calendar will be replaced by a new calendar
within a few thousand years.
The
.B caldate_frommjd
and
.B caldate_mjd
routines will be upgraded accordingly.
The current
.B caldate_frommjd
and
.B caldate_mjd
routines are not useful for dates far in the future.
