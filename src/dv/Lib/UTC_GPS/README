Like any other piece of software (and information generally), libtai
comes with NO WARRANTY.


These are UNIX installation instructions; libtai has not yet been ported
to non-UNIX systems.


1- Compile the programs and format the man pages:

   % make it man

   The manual pages 
   caldate.0    tai.0        tai_pack.0   taia_now.0
   caltime.0    tai_now.0    taia.0       taia_pack.0
   can be read as normal text. 	

2- Create leapsecond data:
   Please find the file called leapsecs.txt in the current directory.
   This is the text file you will be modifying when leap second changes
   are announced. After every modification you have to create the binary
   file called leapsecs.dat which libtai library depends on. 
   leapsecs.dat is read by the routine leapsecs_read.c; at the moment
   leapsecs.dat is stored and read from the current directory, at some
   point you may want to install it in /etc as root, then you have to 
   change the appropriate line in routine leapsecs_read.c to tell it where
   to find the data.
   
   Now create the file leapsecs.dat
   % ./leapsecs < leapsecs.txt > leapsecs.dat
   
3- LIGO specifics:

   There are two routines for LIGO purposes:
   gps-to-utc.c   utc-to-gps.c
   The program 'convert' shows how to use them. First have a look
   at the program convert, enter any date of your choice, then
   run 'make convert', then try running it
   % ./convert

4- Other programs:
	
   
  easter prints the date of Easter in any given year.
   % ./easter 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001


  yearcal prints a year-long calendar.
   % ./yearcal 1997 | ul

  nowutc prints the current time in UTC. (uses a routine from Unix Time
  (eg. The Olson Library) ) 
   % env TZ=right/Etc/GMT date; ./nowutc

Modifications for LIGO are by S. Tilav, tilav@ligo.caltech.edu

Please report any bugs to S. Tilav

The libtai code is in the public domain, so you can use it in your own
programs.
