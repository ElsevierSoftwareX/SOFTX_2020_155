This subdirectory contains a set of widgets which implement the layout
behaviour of Java's LayoutManager classes.  You can see them on the
widget palette in the 'Java Widgets' section.

This directory contains this file, and two directories:

lib/	This directory contains the source files for the widgets themselves,
	a makefile so that you can build them, and a static library which 
	contains a build of the widgets for your system.  When
	building generated code which used the Java widgets, you need
	to ensure that this library is linked in (the default makefile
	does this for you).

h/	This directory contains the header files for the widgets;
	these should be included in any files which use them.  The
	generated code contains appropriate #include statements, of
	course.
