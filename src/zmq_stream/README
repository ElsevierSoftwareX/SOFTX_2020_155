	*** None of the software in this directory is presently suitable for use in a production system.
	*** Code here is intended for prototype testing of 0MX network protocol in FE -> DAQ LAN.

Files:
- zmq_multi_stream.c:
	- Purpose: Send DAQ data for all models running on a single FE computer via the DAQ LAN.  
	- Usage: zmq_multi_stream -s systems, where:
		- systems are space delimited names of all models running on the FE computer 
		  eg -s "x2ioplsc0 x2lsc x2omc x2lscaux"

- zmq_threads.c:
	- Purpose: Receive DAQ data from FE computers. Code uses a thread to connect to each FE computer DAQ net.
	- Usage: zmq_threads -s computer_names, where:
		- computer_names = hostnames corresponding to FE computer DAQ LAN connection.
		  e.g. -s "x2lsc0_daq x2oaf0_daq"

- zmq_multi_rcvr:
	- Purpose: Single threaded version of zmq_threads.c

- zmq_proxy.c
	- Purpose: Receive data from DAQ LAN and retranmit data in channel by channel blocks.

- zmq_proxy_client.c
	- Purpose: Subscribe to live data streams of single or multiple DAQ channels by name
		   from the zmq_proxy.
