NOTICE  ******
	*** None of the software in this directory is presently suitable for use in a production system.
	*** Code here is intended for prototype testing of 0MX network protocol in FE -> DAQ LAN.

Files:
- zmq_multi_stream.c:
	- Purpose: Send DAQ data for all models running on a single FE computer via the DAQ LAN.  
	- Usage: zmq_multi_stream -s systems, where:
		- systems are space delimited names of all models running on the FE computer 
		  eg -s "x2ioplsc0 x2lsc x2omc x2lscaux"
	- Status: Works fine if all models running on the FE
		- Needs plenty of work to handle various fault cases eg not all models running, etc.

- zmq_threads.c:
	- Purpose: DAQ data concentrator. Code uses a thread to connect to each FE computer DAQ net.
	- Usage: zmq_threads -s computer_names, where:
		- computer_names = hostnames corresponding to FE computer DAQ LAN connection.
		  e.g. -s "x2lsc0_daq x2oaf0_daq"
	- Status: Functional to point of being able to rcv data, place into larger DC block and
		retransmit on the DAQ 10G LAN.

- zmq_rcv_from_dc.c:
	- Purpose: Receive DAQ data from data concentrator (zmq_threads).
	- Usage: zmq_rcv_from_dc -s server, where:
		- server is name of data concentrator on DAQ 10G network.
	- Status: Functional to point of being able to rcv data from DC, but doesn't do anything
		with the data as yet.

- zmq_multi_rcvr:
	- Purpose: Single threaded version of zmq_threads.c
	- Status: Not functional, as work continued with zmq_threads instead.

- zmq_proxy.c
	- Purpose: Receive data from DAQ LAN and retranmit data in channel by channel blocks.
	- Status: Limited functionality --  Hard coded to run on x2daqdc0 and limited to
		reading 1 .ini file.

- zmq_proxy_client.c
	- Purpose: Subscribe to live data streams of single or multiple DAQ channels by name
		   from the zmq_proxy.
	- Status: Functional, but limited to use on x2daqnds0 at present. 
	- Usage: zmq_proxy_client channame, where:
		- channame = one or more valid DAQ channel names.
