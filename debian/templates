Template: advligorts/site
Type: string

Template: advligorts/rcg_lib_path
Type: string
Description: Paths to user model files:
 The Real Time Code Generator (RCG) needs to know where to find the
 user MATLAB Simulink .mdl files that describe the real-time models.
 .
 The following should be a colon-separated list of absolute paths to
 directories where user RCG model files will be stored, e.g.:
 .
   /opt/rtcds/usercode/isc:/opt/rtcds/usercode/sus
 .
 Paths can be added or subtracted from this list at a later time by
 editing the RCG_LIB_PATH variable /etc/advligo/env file.


Template: advligorts/advligorts_users
Type: string
Default: controls
Description: Users to add to the 'advligorts' group (space separated):
 Users in the 'advligorts' group will be able to create, install, and
 run real-time models.  Specify below any users that should have these
 RTS priviledges.
 .
 Special dedicated users are not required, but traditionally systems
 are configured to give this permission solely to the 'controls' user,
 which is why it is offered as the default option.
 .
 Any specified users that don't exist will be created automatically.
 Users can be added to this group later with the command:
 .
   adduser $USER advligorts
