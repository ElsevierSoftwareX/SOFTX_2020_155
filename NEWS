Overview of changes for 2.4
===========================

- Changed all remaining floats into doubles in Epics sequencers.
- Improved generated autoburt request file, where all readbacks are
  marked readonly now.
- Added new cdsParameters: biquad, direct_dac_write
- DAQ decimation filtering and oversampling filter is done using biquad form IIR filters.
- Do not update DAQ configuration file (INI file) during installation,
  move it away into archive and install new file, generated based on DAQ
  chanenls list in the RCG model.
- New DCU Id Epics channel, e.g. L1:SUS-ITMX_DCU_ID
- New FE overall state word Epics channel, named e.g. L1:FEC-28_STATE_WORD,
  where the lower 7 bits are set as follows:
  	FE stopped		-	bit 0
	Code timing problem	-	bit 1
	I/O problem		- 	bit 2
	AWG dead		-	bit 3
	DAQ dead		- 	bit 4
	IPC errors detected	-	bit 5
	A/D or D/A overflowed	-	bit 6
- Source code has ./configure script now, which needs to be executed once
  before cmopilation of RCG models can be done. Build can be done in a 
  directory separate from the source now. RCG source can be made read-only now.
- Do not create backup Makefiles in the FE build directory.
- DAQ upgraded from 2MB/sec to 4MB/sec
- DAQ channel list in the RCG models
- DAQ file check performed at run time
- Oscillator and filer module spline ramping
- Filter module spline offset ramping
- Spline ramping phase stability improvements
- Mask input for a filter module with control
- New FE code timing/daq/GDS monitor screens
- FE code watchdog in EPICS sequencer (state word bit 0)
- FPU SSE instructions underflows were turned off and floating point
  denormals are forced to zero by setting FZ and DAZ bits in MXCSR register.
  +-1e-20 limiting code removed from the filters.
- DAQ INI file checker script src/epics/util/iniChk.pl needs to be installed
  in a location on PATH for a front-end system, before the Epics process is
  restarted. A good location is /opt/rtcds/llo/l1/scripts/iniChk.pl.
- Extra EXC part is broken in this release, will be fixed in the next release.
- Added post-build script execution at the end of install step.

Overview of changes from 2.3 
============================
Bug Fixes:
- fixed rogue testpoints shown up at AEI/GEO and LLOLSC

New Feature:
- added flip_signals parameter to make working with buffered and unbuffered
  aa/ai filters easier

Overview of changes from 2.1 to 2.3
===================================

Bug Fixes:
- daqLib.c fixed to support up to 256x decimation for DAQ channels. Previous versions only
provided proper decimation to 32x.
- FiltCtrl.pm bug fix to provide all filter module switch setting bits at status output.
- Bit2Word.pm bug fix.
- controller.c, map.c and map.h changed to support double buffer for DAC outputs. This fixes a bug where
a race condition could exist between the IOP loading new DAC data into the same buffer and at the same time
as the DAC module was trying to DMA data out of that buffer.
- Set the '-2' awgtpman flag for a 4K system in top level Makefile.
- Fixed biquad filter module operation.
- Change inputFilter part to use extensions of GAIN,POLE, ZERO instead of K,P,Z.
- RMS part to have limits of +/-200000 instead of +/-2000.


New Additions:
- Updated dataviewer with support for 32K and 64K resolution data viewing.
- Various updates to support new longer signal names (Max size, with extensions, 60 chars).

Overview of changes from 2.0 to 2.1
==================================
New Branch, which includes:

New Features:
1) RCG provides default code rate in coeff.txt files for use by foton.
2) New IIR filter part based on BiQuad filter algorithm as provided by M. Evans.
3) Ability to include a user-defined library part in an RCG model.
4) Support for connection of buses between multiple layers of the model, not just on save level.
5) Auto-generated EPICS.ini files for each model.
6) Check of 16bit DAC module FIFOs for proper clocking plus new error bit added to GDS_TP screens..
7) Change of _DAQ to _DQ tag on filter modules in DAQ .ini files.

Bug Fixes:
1) Fix to EPICS EZCA part to:
- compile correctly within subsystem parts.
- Use pvPut instead of EZCA for performance reasons (plus EZCA not supported in latest EPICS).
2) Removal of SVN tag from BURT file ie BURT restore would overwrite latest SVN tag).
3) Fix to slave model DAC status info on GDS TP screens (false error indicator).
4) Change in CDS_PARTS.mdl bus selector part to set use to "Require input signal names to match signals below", instead of "Inheri
t bus signal names from input ports". This is required to make BUS parts work with new, multi-level BUS parser in RCG.
