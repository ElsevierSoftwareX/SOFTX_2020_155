Overview of changes from 2.0 to 2.1
==================================
New Branch, which includes:

New Features:
1) RCG provides default code rate in coeff.txt files for use by foton.
2) New IIR filter part based on BiQuad filter algorithm as provided by M. Evans.
3) Ability to include a user-defined library part in an RCG model.
4) Support for connection of buses between multiple layers of the model, not just on save level.
5) Auto-generated EPICS.ini files for each model.
6) Check of 16bit DAC module FIFOs for proper clocking plus new error bit added to GDS_TP screens..
7) Change of _DAQ to _DQ tag on filter modules in DAQ .ini files.

Bug Fixes:
1) Fix to EPICS EZCA part to:
- compile correctly within subsystem parts.
- Use pvPut instead of EZCA for performance reasons (plus EZCA not supported in latest EPICS).
2) Removal of SVN tag from BURT file ie BURT restore would overwrite latest SVN tag).
3) Fix to slave model DAC status info on GDS TP screens (false error indicator).
4) Change in CDS_PARTS.mdl bus selector part to set use to "Require input signal names to match signals below", instead of "Inheri
t bus signal names from input ports". This is required to make BUS parts work with new, multi-level BUS parser in RCG.
