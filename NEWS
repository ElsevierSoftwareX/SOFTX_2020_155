===========================
Overview of changes for 2.4.1
===========================
- fix broken "biquad" flag, it turned out that processing of biquad=1 flag
  was failing in certain cases.
- map.c has fix added for DAC modules with PEX8111 interface chips ie
  all those boards that are native PCIe and not PCM cards (older revs).
- controller.c and cdsHardware.h - Reinstated DAC DMA as default mode after fix above. Since DAC FIFO
  now used as a buffer, of sorts, moved DMA code into DAC write area.
- Broke up read of IRIG-B time across two code cycles (1 to read seconds and one to read usec) to reduce delay this causes on cycle 0 
(GPS 1 second mark) between IOP receipt of ADC data and IOP move of this data for use by
user application processes. 
- Bug fix for I/O error bit in STATE_WORD.
- Fix for ADC part; adc number not parsed correctly to set dWordUsed parameter in C code.
- Fix for Spectracom IRIG-B Year info readout.

===========================
Overview of changes for 2.4
===========================

- Changed all remaining floats into doubles in Epics sequencers.
- Improved generated autoburt request file, where all readbacks are
  marked readonly now.
- Added new cdsParameters setting: biquad.
  biquad=1 forces all filter modules as well as ADC/DAC up/down filters and
  DAQ downsampling filters to be calculated using biquad form.
- Until DMA issues with General Standards DAC modules are resolved the IOP code
  has direct DAC write code enabled, DMA is not used to write to the DAC modules.
- DAQ decimation filtering and oversampling filter is done using biquad form IIR filters,
  if cdsParameters block has biquad=1.
- Do not update DAQ configuration file (INI file) during installation,
  move it away into archive and install new file, generated based on DAQ
  chanenls list in the RCG model.
- New DCU Id Epics channel, e.g. L1:SUS-ITMX_DCU_ID
- New FE overall state word Epics channel, named e.g. L1:FEC-28_STATE_WORD,
  where the lower 7 bits are set as follows:
  	FE stopped		-	bit 0
	Code timing problem	-	bit 1
	I/O problem		- 	bit 2
	AWG dead		-	bit 3
	DAQ dead		- 	bit 4
	IPC errors detected	-	bit 5
	A/D or D/A overflowed	-	bit 6
- Source code has ./configure script now, which needs to be executed once
  before cmopilation of RCG models can be done. Build can be done in a 
  directory separate from the source now. RCG source can be made read-only now.
- Do not create backup Makefiles in the FE build directory.
- DAQ upgraded from 2MB/sec to 4MB/sec.
- DAQ channel list in the RCG models support.
- DAQ file check performed at run time.
- Oscillator and filer module spline ramping
- Filter module spline offset ramping
- Spline ramping phase stability improvements
- Mask input for a filter module with control
- New FE code timing/daq/GDS monitor screens
- FE code watchdog in EPICS sequencer (state word bit 0)
- FPU SSE instructions underflows were turned off and floating point
  denorms were forced to zero by setting FZ and DAZ bits in the CPU MXCSR register.
  +-1e-20 limiting code was removed from the filter code.
- NOTE: DAQ INI file checker script src/epics/util/iniChk.pl needs to be installed
  in a location on PATH for a front-end system, before the Epics process is
  restarted. A good location is /opt/rtcds/llo/l1/scripts/iniChk.pl.
- NOTE: Extra EXC part is broken in this release, will be fixed in the next release.
  It was discovered that this part is not working correctly and needs debugging.
  Filter module excitation works fine as before.
- Added post-build script execution at the end of install step.
  T1100340-v1 https://dcc.ligo.org/cgi-bin/private/DocDB/ShowDocument?docid=63485
- When a brand new model is compiled and started for the first time there is no
  existing burt snapshot for it to restore and it used to be that the operator needed
  to press the BURT button on the GDS screen within 10 seconds in order for the FE kernel
  module start running or else the FE execution failed. This was fixed by writing 1 into
  BURT_RESTORE channel within the generated startup script.
- Linux kernel 3.0.8 (patched with patches/linux-3.0-cs.patch and configured with
  patches/linux-3.0.8-cs.config) was tested at LLO and wwas found working just as well as
  the currently used 2.6.34.1 kernel. mbuf driver (src/drv/mbuf) was modified to
  compile on 3.0.8 kernel.
- New Epics channel added to show the total number of testpoint selected L1:FEC-7_TP_CNT.
- Added DAC Duotone  measurement feature along with the selection switch L1:FEC-7_DACDT_ENABLE.
- The startup script now looks for an optional safe.snap file, e.g.
  /opt/rtcds/llo/l1/target/l1lsctest/l1lsctestepics/burt/safe.snap
  and burt restores this file instead of the latest burt snapshot.


Overview of changes from 2.3 
============================
Bug Fixes:
- fixed rogue testpoints shown up at AEI/GEO and LLOLSC

New Feature:
- added flip_signals parameter to make working with buffered and unbuffered
  aa/ai filters easier

Overview of changes from 2.1 to 2.3
===================================

Bug Fixes:
- daqLib.c fixed to support up to 256x decimation for DAQ channels. Previous versions only
provided proper decimation to 32x.
- FiltCtrl.pm bug fix to provide all filter module switch setting bits at status output.
- Bit2Word.pm bug fix.
- controller.c, map.c and map.h changed to support double buffer for DAC outputs. This fixes a bug where
a race condition could exist between the IOP loading new DAC data into the same buffer and at the same time
as the DAC module was trying to DMA data out of that buffer.
- Set the '-2' awgtpman flag for a 4K system in top level Makefile.
- Fixed biquad filter module operation.
- Change inputFilter part to use extensions of GAIN,POLE, ZERO instead of K,P,Z.
- RMS part to have limits of +/-200000 instead of +/-2000.


New Additions:
- Updated dataviewer with support for 32K and 64K resolution data viewing.
- Various updates to support new longer signal names (Max size, with extensions, 60 chars).

Overview of changes from 2.0 to 2.1
==================================
New Branch, which includes:

New Features:
1) RCG provides default code rate in coeff.txt files for use by foton.
2) New IIR filter part based on BiQuad filter algorithm as provided by M. Evans.
3) Ability to include a user-defined library part in an RCG model.
4) Support for connection of buses between multiple layers of the model, not just on save level.
5) Auto-generated EPICS.ini files for each model.
6) Check of 16bit DAC module FIFOs for proper clocking plus new error bit added to GDS_TP screens..
7) Change of _DAQ to _DQ tag on filter modules in DAQ .ini files.

Bug Fixes:
1) Fix to EPICS EZCA part to:
- compile correctly within subsystem parts.
- Use pvPut instead of EZCA for performance reasons (plus EZCA not supported in latest EPICS).
2) Removal of SVN tag from BURT file ie BURT restore would overwrite latest SVN tag).
3) Fix to slave model DAC status info on GDS TP screens (false error indicator).
4) Change in CDS_PARTS.mdl bus selector part to set use to "Require input signal names to match signals below", instead of "Inheri
t bus signal names from input ports". This is required to make BUS parts work with new, multi-level BUS parser in RCG.
